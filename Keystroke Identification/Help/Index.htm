		Welcome to the <B><I>Keystroke Biometrics Identification System Help.</B></I>
		Keystroke biometric technique is one of these ideas that can provide us with better security for our protected information. Keystroke identification differ from other biometric techniques where it doesn’t require any special security hardware, it requires only the already existing computer keyboard to measure keystroke dynamic which differ from user to user . Each user has a typing signature for keystroke which relate to the keystroke latencies and pressure measures. These two measures are considered to be unique for each user.
